    Base class for boundary conditions

    Boundary conditions are evaluated by calling BC.evaluate(frequency). The alterations
    on A and b are stored in COO format right in the BC instantiated object.
    Nodes to be removed from the linear system are not deleted right away but marked
    for deletion, allowing to evaluation BC in any order (parallelization in mind!)


    Improvement:
    We could drop b's column index vector since b is a column vector itself.
